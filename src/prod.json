I am not a phone guy, and bought because my daughter, and friends, co workers, etc said its hard impossible to get a hold of me. My old phone was so slow. This has it all, definate buy. I even checked a youtube video on side by side comparison of Xynos and Snapdragon phone and they are basically the same. I keep finding new features with this thing. The super fast charging is epic. I dont know where to start, but this is a definite MUST BUY if you need a phone. I hope there is some left."

But over a few weeks of daily driving my Mac, I found out that I have a big problem with the different dongles I have that I had to carry around me all the time, I have a few USB c to normal USB adapters in my backpack all the time just to have the ability to use my flash drive and portable hdds. Not only is it hard to carry around but it is also very ugly having 3 different adapters plugged in at once! This adapter has all different types of adapters built into it that only uses one USB c port! Plus you can plug in a power cord and charge using the same adapter! It has 3 USB 3.0 ports 4 USB 2 ports, a 4K HDMI out, USB c power in, an sd card reader and to me personally the vga port is very useful when presenting a slideshow I can plug it in to the projector in our office. What surprises me the most is that you can charge and transfer files from USB stick to MacBook simultaneously while still have fast transfer speed. I occasionally transfer photos from an sd card to my computer, and this solved the problem perfectly! I was able to transfer photos and documents quickly and at full speed! Highly recommended to every MacBook owner, just make sure your device supports this!"

        "ReviewDesc": "I bought a couple of USB-C hubs in the past which have worked really well. The specific ones were from the brand ICZI and I think Choetech. I needed another one that I could just keep in my bag so that I did not have to unplug everything at home all the time from the ones I have at my desk and my wife\u2019s desk. This one was a 14-in-1 (my ones at home are only 11-in-1 and 8-in-1 I believe) and this one was much cheaper than the ones I bought previously. Overall, quite happy with my purchase. The ports all work great and I tried plugging in as many devices as I could to see if I could overwhelm it but it continued to work as if there was only one device plugged in (no slow downs). What I especially like about this are the two USB-C ports vs. my other ones which only have one USB-C port which is constantly used by the power adapter so I technically lose it. The only con is that it is a bit heavy."

Unfortunately there is no single hub from Apple offering all options and you need two hubs in best case with combined cost of 200$, if not more. I am happy with this as a cost optimal solution where I can connect to both home monitor via HDMI and home lab server via LAN at the same time. VGA port is a plus as I dont have to worry about display connector type at customer offices."

I recently started a new job and they provided me with a Macbook Pro. Of course these new Macbooks have no ports except for USB-C and I want to use my keyboard, mouse, large monitor, wired networking, flash drives, printer, USB audio interface, etc. when working at home. This adapter can keep all of that stuff connected and more!Additionally, I love that it has a power input! I have an extra Macbook charger that I leave plugged in at my desk. I can plug it into this adapter so that not only will the adapter output to all the devices I mentioned above, it will also charge/power the laptop! Truly a 1-cable solution that doesn't require an expensive Thunderbolt dock."

        "ReviewDesc": "I mainly got this for my MacBook. I got a new job where I do a lot of presentations, however the projectors at work only have VGA and not HDMI. I could have got an HDMI to VGA adapter, but for some reason they don't work well with USB-C dongles; so I decided to get another dongle. This one is particular for a couple of reasons.1) The build quality is very good. It's all metal, it's heavy and it doesn't seem like it'll break or anything. It would be better if the USB-C cable was detachable. It also comes with a carrying pouch.2) It has a lot of ports. It has USB 3.0 ports for data transfer and USB 2.0 ports for peripherals and charging. It also has a gigabit ethernet port as well as an HDMI and VGA. VGA Doesn't work with my iPad, but HDMI does. It can actually charge my iPad as well. The iPad can also recognize more than one external drive and project to an external screen using this dongle.3) It doesn't get warm. I've used it to charge 3-4 devices at the same time while using the VGA and Ethernet ports. My other dongles get significantly warmer than this one.Overall, I really recommend this. It's an all-in-one solution for all your USB-C devices, and as it connects through just one USB-C port, you can use it with a wide variety of devices."

I am using it for a few hours every day and haven't had any overheating issues yet. Also, I like how the case looks; it is aluminum and very lightweight for what it does.

Also, it doesn\u2019t seem to heat the water as much as my previous makers, thus requiring more coffee grounds to be used.And the killer is this was more expensive than my previous Sunbeam and Black & Decker makers."

We're new to Amazon so really glad this machine was as good as others have said and is available at such a great price!  It's very easy to use, nice to have the water level on the front, and contrary to someone's review, the temperature is perfect once it's finished brewing! A full pot does only give two very large cups of coffee but that's perfect for the two of us :)  The reusable filter is great so no need to fiddle with those paper filters that won't come apart first thing in the morning! And it does make some noises at the end of the brewing but that was noted in the instruction sheet (and it does make a full pot in record time).  The only thing negative I could say is that the pot lid doesn't seem to come off so flops around when I'm cleaning it but not a big issue.  Would recommend this to anyone who needs a small coffee maker or lives with a tea drinker!"

Looks great otherwise, if you live alone and would like two mugs of coffee out of a fully made pot, this thing would probably be perfect.Normally I use a french press, which is just enough for two medium-small mugs' worth for myself and my husband daily, but I wanted to jitter boldly into \"second cup of coffee\" territory without doubling my grounds usage. This coffeemaker's glass pot is NOT 5 cups as in 5 x 250ml, the total volume of the pot, if you filled it with water right to the brim, would be maybe 4 liquid 250ml cups, and if you follow the markings to the max \"5 cups\" maybe 3 250ml cups? So I don't know what the markings on the pot refer to, but it's not what I would call 5 cups of coffee.Anyway, I'm returning it unused because it's simply too small. I wish I hadn't wasted a month waiting for this darn thing and that I'd just ordered a 12-cup one at the outset. Live and learn!"

All pluses.5 cups is a bit of a stretch if you take into consideration the size of the coffee pictured. It makes just less than two cups of this particular cup. Simple to operate and set up as would be the standard. Having a basket strainer was one of the reasons I wanted this. It didn't affect operation of the machine or flavour but the basket bottom is oddly solid. I assume this makes it more sturdy. My only thought is the molding of the plastic bottom could be shaped differently to allow the water to drain out better as it has a small lip. Again it didn't seem to be an issue. Just a thought. All in all seems decent. I hope it lasts"

Unfortunately it quit working after about 2 months of light use but Amazon replaced with a new one right away and it has been working great with no issues. Use daily. My only complaint is the included filter basket should have some kind of drainage on the bottom of basket, as the grounds stay very wet.Update to original post as ive only brewed about 10 to 12 pots of coffee with this maker and it will no longer brew. The power light comes on when turned on but nothing else happens. Completely disappointed and now amazon wont even speak with me about it."

The device works as expected after the initial churn of setting up.==========================Original Review================1. Alexa setup takes 30 mins. Despite having good IT skills myself, I cannot figure out why it cannot connect to my wifi. I have to directly add it on my router admin page with its mac address to make it work.2. The app has indeed TWO sets of serrings. One for the app itself which is useless and the real important setting for the dot is hidden. What a counter-intuitive UI??3. The AI itself is horrible. If i want it to voice out current time, it does not understand command like \"display current time\",\"show current time\". And there are countless such simple examples. Come on!I have high hopes for this device but apparently, it needs to be polished."

The quality is reminiscent of my parents muffled boom box from the early 90s. And it's certainly no help that the speaker is located on the BOTTOM of said device. I however am very impressed with the display. It's somehow almost as good as the picture quality on my 8th generation iPad.As my main intentions for this iPad were to listen to music, audiobooks, podcasts and YouTube videos at bedtime the poor audio is a real issue. This would have been a 5 star product otherwise."

There\u2019s no reason why in 2020 it struggles performance-wise with the things it does. Here are some examples:- laggy slow software- asking Alexa to show a Nest camera? Yeah ask like three times before she actually does it. Otherwise she just goes \u201cOkay!\u201d and does nothing. I have 300mbit in this room so that ain\u2019t it chief- asking Alexa to disarm Ring? Every few weeks she forgets that she\u2019s allowed to do that and I have to go into the Alexa app (which is equally trash) to reconfigure that mess- asking Alexa to Arm home? 7/10 times she thinks I said \u201cI\u2019m home\u201d and welcomes me instead. Awful microphones- got a Nest stream going? It will majorly mess up buffering 30 seconds in and go back to the home page- it won\u2019t stop showing dumb suggestions on the Home Screen despite me turning all of that off- the speakers sound like trash so hopefully you weren\u2019t planning on using it for music- did I mention the software quality of both the show and the Alexa app are both tragic?- Alexa as an assistant is dumb as hell and can\u2019t maintain a pulse without installing some \u201cskill\u201d for itThis is the very first tech product that I ended up literally throwing in the garbage from how bad it is. Picture for evidence.If you were thinking about getting this or a Google Home, for the love of christ go with the Google Home, it\u2019s just a different category entirely. Pay to play."

I suggest avoid Amazon products and go with a different company if this is not fixed in a timely manner. not much else to say, other than feature reviews got my excited, but I was quickly let down on setting everything up. ;-/"

It doesn't matter if it's for playing songs or answering questions, view YouTube or find a recipe, 9 times out of 10 it gives us a \"sorry, something went wrong. Please try later\". Netflix still isn't supported and when we ask for recipes for muffins we get recipies for smoothies... The video calling is really choppy and it's hard to make out anything that is being said. I have it paired with another echo to play music but it frequently drops the music in the second speaker.I'm really really hoping it's just Amazon's servers that are overwhelmed from the birthday sale and now black Friday sales but I'm starting to doubt anything will change.Rebooted this thing more times than I can remember but no change."

I almost love it!Here is the trouble.... if you live in a place where the outside temperature is bellow zero degrees Celsius for period of time... like a Canadian winter, you can not expect the battery to hold a charge nor can you expect the attached doorbell wires to keep it charged.This is very disappointing... as winter lasts a few months around here with means weekly taking off the mount, disconnecting the doorbell wires and connecting it to a charger.  Not a big deal except for the fact that it is cold outside... at times too cold to be wanting to be fiddling with those doorbell screws on the back.This is enough to cause me to search out a replacement with an easily removable battery - with is a bummer as the Ring App and system is super fantastic.

The lights can be individually turned on just fine through the App but having them all turn on all at once in their grouped network does not work.  They don't respond at all to motion from the floodlight cam that I have them grouped or vice versa which defeats the whole purpose.  I think there are tons of bugs with this and the software and they should have worked these out before releasing these to the public.  I will be returning and hoping that the next gen is much better quality controlled."

This little machine may look small but it packs a powerful punch of 19 bars of pressure and makes excellent coffee.

It's design and build quality are a cut above. 1-star off as the older model was 'illuminated' when turned on which facilitated operation and looked lovely. It also had an 'on-off' switch lacking in new model likely to cut costs. Finally, a handy carrying case is no longer available - ideal if taking to the office or cottage. Nespresso, please make this available again as it's a very useful accessory and made the Pixie even more portable, its nominal feature."

When lowering the monitor, make sure you hold both corners of the screen and gently push down. Installation was simple enough but no written instruction, just pictures. I couldn\u2019t find any videos for the installation either. Remember to keep the metal pin incase you ever need to transport the monitor. It keeps the stand from accidentally popping up as you are carrying the monitor. I\u2019ve only just installed the monitor so can\u2019t really comment on the graphic or use yet.  However, it turned on and works fine. The price is reasonable for a monitor that swivels, tilt, and has height adjustment. Planing on using it for my kid\u2019s schooling so it will do. I will change the rating after a month or so of using this monitor if nothing goes wrong."

I don't have any regrets with this purchase."

I needed 18-24\" cable to be perfect but seems this length is unavailable. Purchased the CableCreation 3ft cable. Out of the shipping bag the cable seemed too long. Quick measurement on average diameter of cable coils in the bag, therefore circumference/length of coil, multiplied by number of cable coils gave 70\" length, approximately. So they shipped a 6ft cable in a bag labelled as 3ft. Very, very poor."

Very convenient to be able to change the iphone, apple watch and airpods all at once.We did have a few issues with the cord that fits into the back of the unit.  The end of the cord is not a common one and it bends very easily and can easily break if you are not careful.  I am now trying to find a replacement cord.  It would be much easier if they used a common charging cord.Overall, it is definitely worth the money."

Put a gorilla glass on it, had spare from previous watch. The lumination of hands going away very fast, but you can still see it in a completely dark room. Dont know how the battery would behave, but hopefully would never need to replace batteries again. Date and time is easily set. The only thing that pisses me off is that second hand is not aligned with the minute markers. So it cannot be precise on 12 hour mark, it shows 0.5 seconds. However it's not someting that is important. Overall it's a great watch, Personally im finally settled with these ones. Recommend to buy."

In the bright summer sunshine, my watch hand is hanging out the car window to catch the energizing rays to recharge the batteries. It is an easy to read watch and the smaller orange numbers compliment the watch's style. I enjoy wearing it and find it very practical. Really do wish it had an Indiglo feature (..but that would probably drain the batteries power reserve.) I like this watch."

Hard to beat the price and it makes me want to go outside more on sunny days even though it charges with ordinary light.. Has not lost a second in the two weeks I have had it. Jus wish the second hand was as white or luminous as should the hour and min hands.  Hands only stay luminous for a short while only. I did not realize this and find this strange but Its water resistant and no problem in the shower. Great watch for the price......and was delivered within 4 days without Prime."
