I even checked a youtube video on side by side comparison of Xynos and Snapdragon phone and they are basically the same. I keep finding new features with this thing. The super fast charging is epic. I dont know where to start, but this is a definite MUST BUY if you need a phone. I hope there is some left."

With 20 you need to retake photos constantly. Very often you miss your shot because of this. Photos are blurry and garbage. Like the selfie camera is amazing you can see every pore. But actual camera is useless. Dont even use it for road trips or anything really. I regret choosing this . God awful."

I am not a phone guy, and bought because my daughter, and friends, co workers, etc said its hard impossible to get a hold of me. My old phone was so slow. This has it all, definate buy. I even checked a youtube video on side by side comparison of Xynos and Snapdragon phone and they are basically the same. I keep finding new features with this thing. The super fast charging is epic. I dont know where to start, but this is a definite MUST BUY if you need a phone. I hope there is some left."
